          The Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world and is
          considered to be the most popular tourist attraction in the country. A
          symbol of love, the Taj was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his
          queen Mumtaz. Tagore described the Taj as a "teardrop on the cheek of
          eternity". The monument attracts a lot of tourists all around the
          year.

          by various rulers over the centuries. The sight of this glorious
          monument takes you back to the rich history of India.<br /><br />

          structure built over the relics of the Buddha.

          The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from
          red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur,
          and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was
          built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja
          Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur, India. He was so
          inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this
          grand and historical palace.
